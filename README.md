### Key insights
 * Salary Trends Over Time:
   * The average global salary generally increased from 2020 to 2023.
   * However, there was a slight decrease in the average global salary in 2024.
 * Impact of Employee Count:
   * There was a decrease in the number of employees in 2024 (from 2088 to 1237).
   * This decrease in employee count likely contributed to the decrease in the average salary in 2024.
 * Employment Type Analysis:
   * Full-time employment generated the highest average salary, followed by contract employment.
   * Full-time employees were the majority (3831 employees), which likely influenced the overall high average salary.
   * Even when considering the maximum salary (to minimize the influence of employee count), full-time employment still had the highest pay (\$750,000), followed by contract work (\$270,000).
 * Experience Level Analysis:
   * Executive-level employees have the highest average salary.
   * Salary trends by experience level:

     * Senior-level salaries increased consistently from 2020 to 2024.
 * Overall Average Salary and High-Earning Groups:
